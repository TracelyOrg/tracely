Tracely is a real-time observability platform designed specifically for Python applications. It captures every HTTP request, database query, and external call flowing through your app — with zero configuration required.

## Key Features

- **Real-time monitoring** — Watch requests as they happen in the Pulse View live stream with sub-500ms latency.
- **Auto-instrumentation** — Automatically captures routes, middleware, database queries, and external HTTP calls for FastAPI, Django, and Flask.
- **Smart data redaction** — Passwords, tokens, API keys, and PII are automatically masked before data leaves your application.
- **Trace inspection** — Drill into any request to see the full trace tree: parent spans, child queries, external calls, and timing waterfall.
- **Open source** — Self-host or use the cloud. Your data, your choice.

## Architecture

```
Your Python App
    │
    ├── tracely.init()  ← SDK auto-detects framework
    │
    ├── Captures spans (requests, queries, calls)
    │
    ├── Redacts sensitive data (passwords, tokens, PII)
    │
    └── Sends via OTLP/HTTP → Tracely API → Dashboard
```

The SDK operates with sub-1ms overhead per request and less than 10MB memory usage. All errors are caught silently — the SDK never crashes your application.

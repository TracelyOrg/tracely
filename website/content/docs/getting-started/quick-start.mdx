Get from zero to full observability in four steps.

## Step 1: Install

```bash
pip install tracely
```

## Step 2: Set Your API Key

```bash
export TRACELY_API_KEY="trly_your_key_here"
```

You can find your API key in the Tracely dashboard under **Settings → API Keys**. Keys are shown once on creation — store it securely.

## Step 3: Add to Your App

```python
import tracely

tracely.init()
```

Add these two lines at the top of your application entry point — before your framework initializes. That's all the code you need.

## Step 4: Run and Monitor

Start your application as usual:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Open the **Pulse View** in your Tracely dashboard. You'll see every request appear in real-time as traffic flows through your app.

> [!NOTE]
> That's it! Every HTTP request is now automatically captured, along with database queries, external HTTP calls, and middleware execution — all with automatic PII redaction.

## What Gets Captured

| What | How |
|------|-----|
| HTTP requests | Routes, status codes, request/response bodies |
| Database queries | SQLAlchemy queries with timing |
| External calls | httpx/requests calls to external APIs |
| Middleware | ASGI/WSGI middleware execution |

title: Environment Variables
description: All configuration options for the Tracely SDK.
---

The Tracely SDK is configured entirely through environment variables. No code changes needed beyond `tracely.init()`.

## Variables

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `TRACELY_API_KEY` | Yes | — | Project API key in `trly_` format |
| `TRACELY_ENVIRONMENT` | No | `"unknown"` | Environment name (production, staging, dev) |
| `TRACELY_ENDPOINT` | No | Cloud API URL | API endpoint for self-hosted deployments |
| `TRACELY_REDACT_FIELDS` | No | — | Comma-separated additional field names to redact |
| `TRACELY_SERVICE_NAME` | No | Auto-detected | Override the service name sent with spans |

## Example `.env` File

```bash
# Required
TRACELY_API_KEY=trly_abc123def456

# Optional
TRACELY_ENVIRONMENT=production
TRACELY_SERVICE_NAME=my-api
TRACELY_REDACT_FIELDS=my_secret_field,internal_token
```

## API Key

The API key authenticates your application with the Tracely API. Keys use the `trly_` prefix followed by 32 hex characters.

> [!WARNING]
> API keys are shown once on creation. Store them securely — they cannot be retrieved after the initial display.

**When the API key is missing:** The SDK logs a warning and disables instrumentation. Your application continues to run normally without monitoring.

## Service Name

By default, the SDK auto-detects your service name from the framework or module. Set `TRACELY_SERVICE_NAME` to override this when running multiple services in the same project.

## Endpoint

For self-hosted deployments, set `TRACELY_ENDPOINT` to your Tracely API URL. Cloud users don't need to set this.

title: tracely.init()
description: Initialize the Tracely SDK and start auto-instrumentation.
---

`tracely.init()` is the single entry point for the Tracely SDK. It reads configuration, detects your framework, and sets up automatic instrumentation.

## Usage

```python
import tracely

tracely.init()
```

Call this once at application startup, before your framework initializes.

## What Happens on Init

1. **Reads environment variables** — `TRACELY_API_KEY`, `TRACELY_ENVIRONMENT`, etc.
2. **Detects framework** — Inspects loaded modules for FastAPI, Django, or Flask.
3. **Sets up instrumentation** — Hooks into the detected framework, SQLAlchemy, and HTTP clients.
4. **Starts transport** — Opens a connection for sending spans via OTLP/HTTP.

## Behavior

### When API Key is Missing

The SDK logs a warning to stderr and disables all instrumentation. Your application runs normally with zero overhead.

```
[tracely] WARNING: TRACELY_API_KEY not set. Instrumentation disabled.
```

### When API is Unreachable

The SDK buffers span data locally and retries sending silently. No errors are raised — your application is never affected by Tracely API availability.

- Batch sends every 1 second or 50 spans (whichever comes first)
- Retries with exponential backoff: 100ms → 1s → 5s max
- Buffer capped at ~5000 spans to limit memory usage

### Error Handling

The SDK catches all exceptions internally. `tracely.init()` never throws — even with invalid configuration, missing dependencies, or network failures.

> [!NOTE]
> This is by design. An observability SDK should never crash the application it's monitoring.

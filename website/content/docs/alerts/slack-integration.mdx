description: Set up Slack webhooks to receive alert notifications in your Slack workspace.
---

Receive Tracely alert notifications directly in your Slack channels using incoming webhooks.

## Prerequisites

- A Slack workspace where you have permission to add apps
- Admin or member access to the Tracely project

## Step 1: Create a Slack App

1. Go to the [Slack API Apps page](https://api.slack.com/apps)
2. Click **Create New App**
3. Choose **From scratch**
4. Enter an app name (e.g., "Tracely Alerts") and select your workspace
5. Click **Create App**

## Step 2: Enable Incoming Webhooks

1. In your app settings, go to **Incoming Webhooks** in the left sidebar
2. Toggle **Activate Incoming Webhooks** to **On**
3. Click **Add New Webhook to Workspace**
4. Select the channel where you want to receive alerts
5. Click **Allow**

## Step 3: Copy the Webhook URL

After authorization, you'll see a new webhook URL in this format:

```text
https://hooks.slack.com/services/<WORKSPACE_ID>/<CHANNEL_ID>/<TOKEN>
```

The URL will contain your workspace ID, channel ID, and a unique token. Copy this URL — you'll need it to configure Tracely.

> [!WARNING]
> Keep your webhook URL secret. Anyone with the URL can post messages to your channel.

## Step 4: Configure in Tracely

1. Navigate to your project's **Alerts** page
2. Expand the **Notification Channels** section
3. Find the **Slack** card and click **Configure**
4. Paste your webhook URL
5. Click **Save**

## Step 5: Test the Integration

1. Click the **Test** button on the Slack channel card
2. Check your Slack channel for a test message
3. If successful, you'll see a confirmation in Tracely

## Message Format

Tracely sends rich Slack messages using [Block Kit](https://api.slack.com/block-kit) for clear, actionable notifications:

```
+------------------------------------------+
|  Alert: High Error Rate                  |
|  Project: my-api                         |
+------------------------------------------+
|  Severity: CRITICAL                      |
|  Error Rate: 10.5%                       |
|  Threshold: 5.0%                         |
|  Triggered: 2024-01-15 14:30:00 UTC      |
+------------------------------------------+
|  [View Dashboard]                        |
+------------------------------------------+
```

Messages include:
- Alert name and severity (color-coded)
- Project name
- Metric value vs threshold
- Timestamp
- Button to open the dashboard

## Troubleshooting

### "Webhook URL not configured"

Make sure you've entered the full webhook URL starting with `https://hooks.slack.com/services/`.

### "channel_not_found" error

The webhook is tied to a specific channel. If the channel was deleted or renamed, create a new webhook for the correct channel.

### Messages not appearing

1. Check that the Slack channel is enabled in Tracely
2. Verify the webhook URL is correct
3. Ensure your Slack app hasn't been uninstalled
4. Check if alerts are actually firing (view alert history)

### Rate limiting

Slack has rate limits on incoming webhooks. Tracely's 5-minute cooldown helps prevent hitting these limits, but if you have many alerts firing simultaneously, some messages may be delayed.

## Best Practices

1. **Create a dedicated channel** — Use a channel like `#alerts` or `#tracely-alerts` to keep notifications organized
2. **Set channel notifications** — Configure Slack to notify you on new messages in the alerts channel
3. **Use channel topics** — Add the project name to the channel topic for context
4. **Consider multiple channels** — For multiple projects, consider separate channels per project or per severity level

## Security Notes

- Webhook URLs are stored encrypted in Tracely's database
- URLs are never exposed in API responses (only the channel type and enabled status)
- Rotate webhooks periodically by creating new ones in Slack and updating Tracely

description: Set up alerts to monitor your application and get notified when issues occur.

Tracely's alerting system helps you stay on top of your application's health by notifying you when metrics exceed thresholds or critical events occur.

## Alert Types

### Threshold Alerts

Monitor metrics and get notified when they exceed defined thresholds:

- **Error Rate** — Alert when your error rate exceeds a percentage (e.g., > 5%)
- **Latency (p95/p99)** — Alert when response times exceed acceptable limits
- **Request Volume** — Alert on traffic spikes or drops

Threshold alerts are evaluated every 60 seconds against aggregated metrics from the last minute.

### Critical Alerts

Get instant notifications for critical events:

- **5xx Errors** — Immediate notification on server errors
- **Slow Requests** — Alert when individual requests exceed a latency threshold

Critical alerts are evaluated inline during request processing for real-time detection.

## Notification Channels

Tracely supports multiple notification channels to reach your team wherever they work:

| Channel | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Email** | Notifications sent to organization admins and alert creators |
| **Slack** | Rich messages via incoming webhooks |
| **Discord** | Embed notifications via webhooks |

Each project can configure one channel of each type. Channels can be enabled/disabled independently.

## Setting Up Alerts

1. Navigate to your project's **Alerts** page
2. Click **Create Alert** to define alert rules
3. Configure **Notification Channels** in the collapsible section at the bottom
4. Test your channels to verify they're working

## Alert Notifications

When an alert fires, notifications include:

- **Alert name** and severity level
- **Project name** for context
- **Metric value** that triggered the alert
- **Threshold value** that was exceeded
- **Timestamp** of when the alert fired
- **Link** to the dashboard for investigation

### Severity Colors

Notifications are color-coded by severity:

- **Critical** — Red (#FF0000)
- **Warning** — Amber (#FFA500)
- **Info** — Blue (#0000FF)

## Cooldown Period

To prevent alert fatigue, Tracely enforces a 5-minute cooldown between notifications for the same alert. If an alert continues to fire during the cooldown period, notifications are suppressed until the cooldown expires.

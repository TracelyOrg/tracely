---

Receive Tracely alert notifications directly in your Discord server using webhooks.

## Prerequisites

- A Discord server where you have **Manage Webhooks** permission
- Admin or member access to the Tracely project

## Step 1: Create a Discord Webhook

1. Open your Discord server
2. Right-click on the channel where you want to receive alerts
3. Click **Edit Channel**
4. Go to the **Integrations** tab
5. Click **Webhooks**
6. Click **New Webhook**

## Step 2: Configure the Webhook

1. Give your webhook a name (e.g., "Tracely Alerts")
2. Optionally, upload a custom avatar (the Tracely logo works well)
3. Click **Copy Webhook URL**

The URL will look like:

```
https://discord.com/api/webhooks/1234567890/abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```

> [!WARNING]
> Keep your webhook URL secret. Anyone with the URL can post messages to your channel.

## Step 3: Configure in Tracely

1. Navigate to your project's **Alerts** page
2. Expand the **Notification Channels** section
3. Find the **Discord** card and click **Configure**
4. Paste your webhook URL
5. Click **Save**

## Step 4: Test the Integration

1. Click the **Test** button on the Discord channel card
2. Check your Discord channel for a test message
3. If successful, you'll see a confirmation in Tracely

## Message Format

Tracely sends rich Discord messages using [embeds](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/webhook#execute-webhook) for clear, actionable notifications:

The embed includes:
- **Title** — Alert name with severity emoji
- **Color** — Color-coded by severity (red/amber/blue)
- **Description** — Project name
- **Fields** — Metric value, threshold, and timestamp
- **URL** — Click the title to open the dashboard
- **Footer** — Tracely branding and timestamp

### Example Embed

```
+------------------------------------------+
|  Alert: High Error Rate                  |
|  Project: my-api                         |
|                                          |
|  Severity     CRITICAL                   |
|  Error Rate   10.5%                      |
|  Threshold    5.0%                       |
|                                          |
|  Triggered at 2024-01-15 14:30:00 UTC    |
+------------------------------------------+
|  Tracely Alerts                          |
+------------------------------------------+
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Webhook URL not configured"

Make sure you've entered the full webhook URL starting with `https://discord.com/api/webhooks/`.

### "Unknown Webhook" error

The webhook may have been deleted. Create a new webhook in Discord and update the URL in Tracely.

### Messages not appearing

1. Check that the Discord channel is enabled in Tracely
2. Verify the webhook URL is correct
3. Ensure the webhook hasn't been deleted in Discord
4. Check if alerts are actually firing (view alert history)
5. Verify you have permission to view the channel

### Embed not rendering correctly

Discord webhooks occasionally have issues. Try:
1. Testing the webhook again
2. Checking Discord's status page for outages
3. Creating a new webhook

### Rate limiting

Discord has rate limits on webhooks (30 requests per minute per channel). Tracely's 5-minute cooldown helps prevent hitting these limits.

## Best Practices

1. **Create a dedicated channel** — Use a channel like `#alerts` or `#tracely` to keep notifications organized
2. **Set notification settings** — Configure Discord to notify you on new messages in the alerts channel
3. **Use channel categories** — Group alert channels under an "Alerts" or "Monitoring" category
4. **Set permissions** — Consider making the alerts channel read-only for most members
5. **Pin important alerts** — Pin critical alert messages for visibility

## Discord-Specific Features

### Thread Support

Currently, Tracely posts to the main channel. Thread support for grouping related alerts may be added in a future release.

### Mentions

Webhook messages cannot mention users or roles by default. If you need mentions, consider:
- Setting up Discord's notification settings for the channel
- Using Discord's built-in notification triggers based on keywords

## Security Notes

- Webhook URLs are stored encrypted in Tracely's database
- URLs are never exposed in API responses (only the channel type and enabled status)
- Discord webhooks can be regenerated at any time from the channel settings
- Rotate webhooks periodically for security

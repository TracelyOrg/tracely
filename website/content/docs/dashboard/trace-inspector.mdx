description: Drill into individual request traces.
---

The Trace Inspector shows the complete trace tree for a single request — every span, database query, and external call with timing waterfall.

## Features

- **Trace waterfall** — Visual timeline showing span start times and durations
- **Span details** — Click any span to see attributes, status, and timing breakdown
- **Request/response bodies** — Inspect full request and response payloads (with redaction applied)
- **Database queries** — See exact SQL statements and execution times
- **External calls** — See URLs, methods, and response times for external HTTP calls

> [!NOTE]
> Detailed Trace Inspector documentation coming soon. The dashboard is under active development.

The Pulse View is a real-time stream of every HTTP request flowing through your application. Requests appear within 500ms of hitting your server.

## Features

- **Method + path** — See the HTTP method, route, status code, and response time
- **Color-coded status** — Green for 2xx, amber for 4xx, red for 5xx
- **Filtering** — Filter by method, status code, or path pattern
- **Click to inspect** — Click any request to open the full trace in the Trace Inspector
